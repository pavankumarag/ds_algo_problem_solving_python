"""
Given a sorted array of integers A(0 based index) of size N, find the starting and ending position of a given
integar B in array A.

Your algorithmâ€™s runtime complexity must be in the order of O(log n).

Return an array of size 2, such that first element = starting position of B in A and second element = ending position
 of B in A, if B is not found in A return [-1, -1].


For Example

Input 1:
    A = [5, 7, 7, 8, 8, 10]
    B = 8
Output 1:
    [3, 4]
Explanation 1:
    First occurence of 8 in A is at index 3
    Second occurence of 8 in A is at index 4
    ans = [3, 4]

Input 2:
    A = [5, 17, 100, 111]
    B = 3
Output 2:
    [-1, -1]
